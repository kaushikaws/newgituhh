AWS:

1. WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF EC2 MODEL ?

On-Demand Instances: 
In this model, based on the instances you choose, you pay for compute capacity per hour or per second (only for Linux Instances) and no upfront payments are needed. You can increase or decrease your compute capacity to meet the demands of your application and only pay for the instance you use.This model is suitable for developing/testing application with short-term or unpredictable workloads.On-Demand Instances is recommended for users who prefer low cost and flexible EC2 Instances without upfront payments or long-term commitments.
Spot Instances: 
Amazon EC2 Spot Instances is unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud. Spot Instances are available at up to a 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices. The Spot price of Amazon EC2 spot Instances fluctuates periodically based on supply and demand.It supports both per hour and per second (only for Linux Instances) billing schemes . Applications that have flexible start and end times and users with urgent computing needs for large scale dynamic workload can choose Amazon EC2 spot Instances.
3.Reserved Instances: 
Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances provide you with a discount up to 75% compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.It also provides capacity reservation when used in specific Availability Zone.For applications that have predictable workload, Reserved Instances can provide sufficient savings compared to On-Demand Instances.The predictability of usage ensures compute capacity is available when needed.Customers can commit to using EC2 over a 1- or 3-year term to reduce their total computing costs.
Dedicated Hosts: 
A Dedicated Host is a physical EC2 server dedicated for your use.Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses like Windows server, SQL server etc and also helps you to meet the compliance requirements .Customers who choose Dedicated Hosts have to pay the On-Demand price for every hour the host is active in the account.It supports only per-hour billing and does not support per-second billing scheme.
